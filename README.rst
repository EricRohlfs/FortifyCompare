===============

Simple script to compare two Fortify files.

Install Instructions
====================

I'm pretty sure I'm doing this wrong, but needed to get something out the door quickly.
Please help me improve this process.

On Windows:

- make sure python is installed
- open the command prompt and type:

  `pip install fortify_compare`

- put the two fortify files in a folder.
- download the runner.py file into the same folder
- run the following command:

  `python runner.py file_name_old file_name_new`

On Linux:

If you are using linux, I'm confident you already know a better way of doing this.
